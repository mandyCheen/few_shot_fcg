10way_10shot GAT 6 CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 1.53 GiB. GPU 0 has a total capacity of 14.53 GiB of which 954.88 MiB is free. Process 84509 has 52.00 MiB memory in use. Including non-PyTorch memory, this process has 13.53 GiB memory in use. Of the allocated memory 11.41 GiB is allocated by PyTorch, and 2.01 GiB is reserved by PyTorch but unallocated. If reserved but unallocated memory is large try setting PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True to avoid fragmentation.
