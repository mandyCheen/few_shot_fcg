Including non-PyTorch memory, this process has 8.69 GiB memory in use. Of the allocated memory 6.31 GiB is allocated by PyTorch, and 2.04 GiB is reserved by PyTorch but unallocated. If reserved but unallocated memory is large try setting PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True to avoid fragmentation.
